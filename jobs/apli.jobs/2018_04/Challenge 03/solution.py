"""
You are being attacked by an army of robots!
Ok, we not that already.

We also know already how many shots we need to kill all approaching metal heads.
But what we don't know is, if we are able to survive the attack!!

So we need an additional function will_we_survive(robots, distance) that accepts a list of robots,
and how many meters away they are.

Now, knowing that reloading a front loader takes exactly 10 seconds, and that
the approaching row of robots jumps 10 meters forward every 5 seconds, your function
must return a boolean value if we can kill all robots in time.

Remember that your gun is empty at the beginning of the attack!
