"""
Write the function question_marks(testString)  that accepts a string parameter,
which will contain single digit numbers, letters, and question marks,
and check if there are exactly 3 question marks between every pair of two
numbers that add up to 10.
If so, then your program should return the string true, otherwise it should
return the string false.
If there aren't any two numbers that add up to 10 in the string, then your
program should return false as well.

For example: if str is "arrb6???4xxbl5???eee5" then your program should
return True because there are exactly 3 question marks between 6 and 4, and
3 question marks between 5 and 5 at the end of the string.


Sample Test Cases
Input:"arrb6???4xxbl5???eee5"
Output: True

Input:"aa6?9"
Output: False

Input:"acc?7??sss?3rr1??????5ff"
Output: True
